# Crowd Counting

This repository is an implementation of crowd counting described in the paper "Image Crowd Counting Using Convolutional Neural Network and Markov Random Field". The fully connected regress network is implemented by Keras (Tensorflow backend). Others are implemented by Matlab.

### Prepare

0. Downloading data at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/garodovussfijta/AAABTgM_Ut19Be4kGzHqf6MUa?dl=0 or https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gfjcdbX and put it at the root folder of the project.
0. Compiling the MRF code using CMake by running the file CMakeLists.txt in the root folder.
0. Finishing setup by running testMRF.m in MRF folder.

### Evalute

You can direct evalute the model's performance by running EvaluteUCF.m or EvaluateSHT.m using predicted patches' count. This process will apply Markov Random Field and get the global count.

### Training a new model
If you want to train a new regress model, follow these steps:

0. Install MatConvNet and then run ExtractFeatures.m to extract features. This step is not necessary if you use the extracted features in the data folder.
0. Install Keras and run regress_UCF.py or regress_SHT.py to train a new regress network. Also, you can run patch_predict_SHT.py or patch_predict_UCF.py to predict the patches' count using trained regress network.
0. Running EvaluteUCF.m or EvaluateSHT.m to evalute the model's performance.
